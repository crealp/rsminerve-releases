## Automatic Model *Creation*

The *Creation* tool in the *Model Management* frame automatizes the
creation of hydrological models based on the GIS layers where the
hydrological objects, the confluences and their links are defined. This
tool connects the objects (which represent the different subbasins) with
their corresponding downstream junctions (that represent the outlets of
each subbasin); theses junctions with the downstream rivers that
transport the discharges generated in the subbasins; and finally these
rivers with the outlet downstream junctions.

The structure of the GIS layers has to be edited under the following
format:

- The **subbasins** layer must contain an attribute column with the ID of the downstream junctions (the outlets of each subbasin).

- The **junctions** layer must contain an attribute column with the ID of the downstream rivers that will transport the discharges. Also, one of the attribute columns must correspond with the ID indicated in the subbasins and the rivers layers.

- The **rivers** layer must contain an attribute column with the ID of the downstream outlet junctions.

Once the different layers have been added to the interface, it is
possible to use *Creation*:

- <span style="color:blue">Click *Creation* in the *Model Management* frame.</span>

A *Configuration* area with three parts --*Subbasins*, *Junctions* and
*Rivers*-- as well as an attribute table (for the selected layer) should
appear below the GIS interface (@fig-gis_creation_interface).

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Subbasins* part, select the name of the layer that contains
  the subbasins information (*Layer name*), the attribute that
  contains the basins name (*Basins name*) and the ID of the
  downstream junctions to be linked to the subbasins (*Junctions ID*).
  You can create submodels based on Basins ID, by choosing the
  corresponding ID field.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Junctions* part, select the name of the layer that contains
  the junctions information (*Layer name*), the attribute that
  contains the junctions name (*Junctions name*), the ID field of the
  junctions that will be linked to the downstream rivers (*Junctions
  ID*), and the ID field of the rivers that will be linked (*Rivers
  ID*).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">If you want to create river sections, choose the option in the
  *Rivers* part (*Create rivers*), select the name of the layer that
  contains the rivers information (*Layer name*), the attribute that
  contains the rivers name (*Rivers name*), the ID field of the rivers
  that will be linked to the downstream junctions (*Rivers ID*), and
  the ID field of the downstream junctions that will be linked
  (*Junctions ID*).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Allocate SubBasins Type*, select the different subbasins
  entities aggregated per type by holding Ctrl while clicking (Step 5
  in @fig-gis_creation_interface). Choose the type of object to create (like SOCONT or
  GSM) and click *Allocate Subbasins*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Allocate Rivers Type*, select the different rivers entities
  aggregated per type by holding Ctrl while clicking (Step 6 in @fig-gis_creation_interface). 
  Choose the type of object to create (like Kinematic Wave) and
  click *Allocate Rivers*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click *Create Model* to create all the objects and their links
  defined in the GIS layers.</span>

![Model Creation interface in the GIS](figures/fig-gis_creation_interface.png){#fig-gis_creation_interface}

:::{.callout-important}
The *Creation* tool defines automatically the parameters $Surface$, $X$
and $Y$ of the objects; the definition of the $Z$ parameter is optional
using the option *Altitude (Z)*. For the definition of the rest of
parameters, please use the *Edition* tool.
:::   

If you use the default layers names, the program will load automatically
the specific fields. The names are shown in @fig-gis_default_layers_names.

![Default layers names to autofill fields](figures/fig-gis_default_layers_names.png){#fig-gis_default_layers_names}

## Model *Edition*

With the *Edition* tool in the *Model Management* frame, the user can
manually edit existing objects and links, create new ones, or remove
some of them.

Once the GIS layers have been added and/or the hydrological objects have
been created,

- <span style="color:blue">Select the layer on the left side of the GIS tab.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click *Edition* in the *Model Management* frame.</span>

An attribute table (for the selected entities) as well as an action area
with three tabs should appear below the GIS interface (@fig-gis_model_edition_interface),

- <span style="color:blue">Select features of the selected layer in order to bring them up in
    the attribute table (use the *Select All* button to select all
    features).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">In the action area, select in the drop-down menu a Field Name (layer
    attribute) that should be used to identify features.</span>

![Model Edition interface in the GIS and its workflow](figures/fig-gis_model_edition_interface.png){#fig-gis_model_edition_interface}


The three tabs offer you the possibility of the following actions:

- **Create Objects**: Create model objects from GIS features.

- **Model-GIS Links**: Link GIS features to existing model objects.

- **Export Properties**: Export feature properties to properties (parameters) of model objects.

### Create Objects

In the following example, we are going to generate a sub-model of the
subcatchment highlighted in blue in @fig-gis_model_edition_interface, which has both normal and
glacial elevation bands.

- <span style="color:blue">Select the *Create Objects action tab*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select all non-glacial features by holding Ctrl while clicking (Step
  3 in @fig-gis_model_edition_interface). Using the sorting tool for the attribute table
  might help to order the objects.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Under *Type of Object to create*, select a non-glacial basin model (like SOCONT).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Put a check on *Also Create Virtual Weather Stations*.</span> Now, a
  virtual weather station will be created for and linked to each created object.

- <span style="color:blue">Put a check on *Also link basins to a Junction*.</span> Now, all created
    objects will be linked to a single newly created junction.

- <span style="color:blue">Under *Select Model*, select the model in which you wish to place
  the newly created objects. In our case, this is the parent model.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Put a check on *Create new Submodel* and give it a name.</span> Now, a
  submodel will be created and contain all the newly created objects.

- <span style="color:blue">Click *Create Objects*.</span>

Once the creation process is finished, a message is displayed and object
icons are displayed next to each of the features, to indicate that the
features and the objects have been linked (@fig-gis_object_creation_process).

![Object creation process completed](figures/fig-gis_object_creation_process.png){#fig-gis_object_creation_process}

We then create the glacial objects:

- <span style="color:blue">Select glacial features by holding Ctrl while clicking (Step 3 in @fig-gis_model_edition_interface).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Under *Type of Object to create*, select a glacial basin model (like GSM).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Put a check on *Also Create Virtual Weather Stations*.</span> Now, a
  virtual weather station will be created for and linked to each created object.

- <span style="color:blue">Put a check on *Also link basins to a Junction*.</span> Now, all created
  objects will be linked to another single newly created junction.

- <span style="color:blue">Under *Select Model*, select the model in which you wish to place
  all newly created objects. [In our case, this is the model that was previously created]{.underline}.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Remove the check from *Create new Submodel*, since we created our submodel in the last step.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click *Create Objects*.</span>

If we now view the hydraulic submodel that was created we see that all
the SOCONT and GSM objects were created and linked to both a junction
and a virtual station (@fig-gis_automatic_generated_objects).

![Automatically generated objects](figures/fig-gis_automatic_generated_objects.png){#fig-gis_automatic_generated_objects}

It is still necessary to link the junctions to a group interface and
define certain properties of the basins (area) and virtual stations
(coordinates) in order for the submodel to be complete. In *Export
Properties*, we see how these properties can be exported by bulk from
the linked shapefile features.

### Model-GIS Links

It is important that model objects be linked with GIS features for two
reasons. First, it allows properties to be efficiently exported from the
features to the object (see next section). Second, it allows model
simulation results to be viewed in the GIS (see @fig-gis_hydro_model_visualization).

In the following, we explain how to remove and create a link between a
feature and an existing model object.

#### Link creation

To create a link,

- <span style="color:blue">Select an unlinked feature in the link viewer.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select a model object in the right-hand list.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click the *link* icon situated below the *Auto-Link* button.</span>

#### Link removal

To remove a link,

- <span style="color:blue">Select the link you wish to remove in the link viewer on left side of @fig-gis_linking_unlinking_elements.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click the *unlink* icon situated below the *Auto-Link* button.</span>

![Linking and unlinking elements. Here, the two unlinked elements are ready to be linked](figures/fig-gis_linking_unlinking_elements.png){#fig-gis_linking_unlinking_elements}

#### Auto-linking objects

If the object names match the Field Name displayed in the link viewer,
then you can use the *Auto-Link* button to match and link the elements
automatically.

### Export Properties

Properties can be exported from a linked feature directly to the basin
model or to its associated virtual weather station. There are two
properties that you will definitely want to export from the GIS to the
hydraulic model: Basin area and the coordinates of the virtual weather
station of each basin.

![Exporting feature attributes to model objects](figures/fig-gis_exporting_feature_attributes.png){#fig-gis_exporting_feature_attributes}

#### Export pre-calculated feature attributes

In order to use a feature attribute as a model parameter value,

- <span style="color:blue">Select a linked pair of elements in the *Export Properties* tab.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Navigate to the model parameter that you wish to change, and in the
  drop-down list, select the attribute of the linked feature that should be used.</span>

#### Compute properties from the shapefile

The area of a basin, as well as average X and Y coordinates, can be
calculated directly from the feature itself instead of using a
pre-calculated feature attribute. In order to do that,

- <span style="color:blue">Select a linked pair of elements in the *Export Properties* tab.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">To compute the area for the different sub-basins, select *Compute Area from Shapefile*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">To compute the centre of gravity for the virtual weather station, select *Compute (X,Y) Coordinates from Shapefile*.</span>

The action can be performed on multiple pairs at the same time, but only
pairs of objects of the same type (i.e. only pairs of SOCONT objects).
The action cannot be applied to different object types at the same time
because different object types have different sets of parameters.

## Hydro Model Visualization

The *Model Visualization* module lets you visualize and edit model
information from within the GIS interface. There are three tabs for
interaction:

- **Object Info**: view and edit model object parameters.

- **Solver**: run a simulation.

- **Spatial View**: Change the colours of GIS features based on values from linked objects.

:::{.callout-important}
Shapefile features must be linked to a model object to display information
:::

### Spatial View

The Spatial View (@fig-gis_hydro_model_visualization) allows you to visualize results,
parameters, or initial conditions at each of the objects.

![Hydro Model Visualization: interface workflow in the Spatial View](figures/fig-gis_hydro_model_visualization.png){#fig-gis_hydro_model_visualization}

In order to perform a visualization,

- <span style="color:blue">Select the layer that you wish to visualize. Features from this layer must be linked with model objects.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select the *Spatial View* tab.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select the object types that you wish to visualize. Multiple selections can be made, but different object types **must** share a parameter in order to be displayed.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select the parameter type from either *Results, Parameters, or Initial Conditions*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select the parameter that you wish to display.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">If you are viewing simulation results, select the date for which results should be displayed.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Optional: change color settings.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click on *Visualize*.</span>

## DB Stations Visualization

The *DB Stations Visualization* tool allows spatial representation of
the stations contained in a database or a dataset.

The stations are represented directly in the GIS interface. The
coordinates are taken from the X, Y and Z coordinates from the position
of the stations.

### Data requirements

The input is composed of a dataset or a database (RS MINERVE format).

### Procedure

The steps to plot in GIS the stations' location are presented hereafter.

- <span style="color:blue">In GIS, click on the *DB Stations Visualization* button (*Toolbox* frame).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Select the dataset or the database to be considered.</span>

A new layer of points is created and displayed in the GIS interface (@fig-gis_visualization_stations_location). The user can posteriorly save the layer.
