#  Example 1 -- Simple basin with only runoff {#sec-examples_ex1}

In the first example the objective is to model the production of a net
rain-flow of three impermeable basins, then the propagation of two
hydrographs, the implementing of three inflows at a confluence and
finally their propagation to the model outlet (@fig-examples_model_scheme_ex1).

![Model scheme](figures/fig-examples_model_scheme_ex1.png){#fig-examples_model_scheme_ex1}

The three impermeable surfaces are supposed to be located in the same
region, thus receiving an identical precipitation. Each surface has its
own outlet into different rivers (A and B) which are joined later on in
a single final river (C) before flowing into the outlet of the model.
The parameters and the state variables of the three surfaces, of the
three rivers and the precipitation data are provided in @fig-examples_characteristics_ex1. 
The three rivers are modeled with the kinematic wave model.

## Objective of Example 1

The requested result is the hydrograph at the model outlet during 24
hours, after the beginning of the precipitation, as well as the peak
discharge and the peak time.

The simulation parameters are:

-   Simulation time step = 600 s

-   Recording time step = 600 s

A uniform and null ETP is assumed for this example (the user can check
the selected ETP method in the RS MINERVE settings).

## Resolution of Example 1

This first example is a simplified representation of the reality.
Despite of that, it allows the familiarization with the concept of *RS MINERVE* 
and to know more about its hydrological objects.

At first, the object "Time Series" ![](figures/fig-icon_object_timeseries.png){width="0.24in"} 
is introduced. Clicking once on its icon
in the *Objects frame*, a pen appears. You can then click in the graphic
interface for creating the object in the position you want. Next, the
three run-off surfaces are created by means of the object "SWMM"
![](figures/fig-icon_object_swmm.png){width="0.24in"}. 
The three rivers are introduced by
selecting the model "Kinematic Wave"
![](figures/fig-icon_object_kinem.png){width="0.24in"}. The model
built-up will be finished with the introduction of the two objects
"Junction" ![](figures/fig-icon_object_junction.png){width="0.24in"}.

The graphical interface at this stage is presented in @fig-examples_graphic_interface_rsm_ex1.

![Graphic interface of RS MINERVE with the new objects](figures/fig-examples_graphic_interface_rsm_ex1.png){#fig-examples_graphic_interface_rsm_ex1}

After creating the new objects, topological links or connections have to
be established. To do so, it is sufficient to press once the space bar
of the keyboard to pass in "connections" mode. In Editing tools, the
Connections button is then automatically pressed (@fig-examples_editing_tools_frame_connection). Flying
over each objet, the curser presented before as an arrow now appears as
a cross. Next, click from the object "Time Series" to the object "SWMM1", 
thus creating a topological link.

![Editing tools frame in Connections mode](figures/fig-examples_editing_tools_frame_connection.png){#fig-examples_editing_tools_frame_connection}

The others objects are connected in the same way. Press again the space
bar of the keyboard to return to selection mode. The construction of all
the model objects and the resulting topologic links is thus achieved as
presented in @fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex1 and it only 
remains the introduction of the parameters.

![Topologic links between the different objects from the model](figures/fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex1.png){#fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex1}

By double clicking on the links just created (blue arrows), the
information transferred between "Time Series" and the three run-off
surfaces as well as that between all other objects from up- to
downstream is verified (@fig-examples_different_connections).

![Examples of different connections of the presented model](figures/fig-examples_different_connections.png){#fig-examples_different_connections}

In clicking double on the Time Series object, the associated frame is
opened on the right of the screen and the values "*Time (s) - P (mm/h)*"
are introduced (@fig-examples_values_timeseries).

![Values of the "Time series"](figures/fig-examples_values_timeseries.png){#fig-examples_values_timeseries}

Next, for each SWMM object (![](figures/fig-icon_object_swmm.png){width="0.24in"}), 
the respective parameters (values available in @fig-examples_characteristics_ex1) 
are defined by double clicking on every object and
introducing them by the help of the both Parameters and Initial
conditions frames. The parameters of the Rivers are introduced in the
same way (@fig-examples_param_ic_swmm_river_ex1).

![Parameters and initial conditions frames of SWMM 1 (left) and of River A (right)](figures/fig-examples_param_ic_swmm_river_ex1.png){#fig-examples_param_ic_swmm_river_ex1}

The date parameters of the simulation are modified in Solver frame on
the left of the screen (@fig-examples_solver_frame) before the calculation. For both
dates "Start" and "End" an arbitrary date is proposed, but the
"End" date has to finish 24 hours later than "Start" date. The
"Simulation time step" and the "Recording time step" have a value of 600 s.

![Solver frame](figures/fig-examples_solver_frame.png){#fig-examples_solver_frame}

Constructed final model can be now saved clicking in the button
![](figures/fig-icon_save_button.png){width="0.19in"} and giving a name to the file (e.g.
"Example1.rsm"). This way the model could be loaded later to do new
simulations (@fig-examples_project_frame).

![Project frame](figures/fig-examples_project_frame.png){#fig-examples_project_frame}

Before running calculation, a pre-simulation validation of the model
parameterization can be made in clicking in the button
![](figures/fig-icon_validation.png){height="0.24in"} (Solver frame). 
Its report is summarized on the right of the interface.

Finally, the simulation is initiated by clicking on the button Start in
the Solver frame.

## Results of Example 1

In order to access to the calculation results for each object it has to
be clicked two times on any of them. For example, clicking double on the
object Outlet, its dialog box is opened on the right and the simulated
hydrograph, being the objective of the Example 1, is shown (@fig-examples_results_simulation_ex1).

![Results of the simulation in the outlet of the model](figures/fig-examples_results_simulation_ex1.png){#fig-examples_results_simulation_ex1}

If we check the values (@fig-examples_discharge_values_ex1), we can found that the maximal
discharge (28.442 m^3^/s) arrives at 09:20 (assuming the simulation
starts at 00:00).
