# File formats {#sec-tech_file_formats}

RS MINERVE generates model files saved in **.rsm** format as well as
different other formats for results of configuration data.

## Model files

Both *Save* and *Export* generate files of the same format (***.rsm***).
With *Save*, the entire model is saved, whereas with *Export*, only the
objects (submodels included) contained in the active hierarchical level
are exported (refer to the **Exportation of a submodel** section in the
User's Manual).

## Parameters and initial conditions files {#sec-tech_file_formats_param_ic_files}

Parameters (or initial conditions) of the model can be saved as:

-   Excel files (***.xlsx***). Each worksheet presents the parameters
    (or initial conditions) of one hydrological object, as presented in
    the example of @fig-example_gsm_param_excel_file.

-   Text files (***.txt***). Each hydrological object is presented per
    line with its parameters or initial conditions

## Object selection files

A selection of the objects data can be saved with the help of the
"Selection and plots". The exported selection is saved as a ***.chk***
file. The format of this file is presented in @fig-example_select_series_chk_file. It contains:

-   the name of the selection (given by the user in the "Selection and
    plots") in first line,

-   the number of selected series (second line),

-   all selections, with the name of the **.rsm** model, the name
    submodel (if it exists), the name of the selected object and its
    chosen series.

## Exported results files

The results in the model selection can be also achieved from the
"*Selection and plots*". Several file formats are possible:

-   Excel file (***.xlsx***).

-   CSV file (***.csv***).

-   Aquatool input file (***.apo***), for use's working with Aquatool DMA
    from UPV.

## Calibration configuration files

The full configuration of the calibration, with information such as the
selected objects, parameters to calibrate, or the objective function to
take into account, is saved in a **.cbt** file.

## Database files

The format of the database is explained in detail in @sec-tech_database_formats.
Databases contains two different files

-   Database files in text format (***.dbt*** and ***.dbx***) or in
    binary format (***.dbb*** and ***.dbx***).

-   Dataset files in text format (***.dst*** and ***.dsx***) or in
    binary format (***.dsb*** and ***.dsx***).

-   CSV files in text format (***.csv***).
