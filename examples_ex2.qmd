#  Example 2 -- Combined full basin with meteorological stations {#sec-examples_ex2}

The hydrological system proposed by the Example 2 includes four
hydrological models of production, a GSM and three HBV models as well as
the rivers of the basin. The discharge production in the sub-basins area
is based on given precipitations and temperatures from a database.

This expected model is represented in @fig-examples_model_scheme_ex2.

![Model scheme](figures/fig-examples_model_scheme_ex2.png){#fig-examples_model_scheme_ex2}

The parameters of the objects are provided in @fig-examples_characteristics_ex2_1
to @fig-examples_characteristics_ex2_3 and the
precipitation and temperature data are in the database "Database
manual".

## Objective of Example 2

The objective of this example is to determine the hydrograph in the
outlet of the system during the period between the 08.05.2013 00:00 and
the 15.05.2013 00:00, the peak discharge and the peak time, as well as
the discharge created at the outlet of each sub-basin.

The simulation parameters are:

-   Simulation time step = 600 s

-   Recording time step = 600 s

A uniform and null ETP is assumed for this example (the user can check
the selected ETP method in the RS MINERVE settings).

Besides, two meteorological real stations are included in the data base:

## Resolution of Example 2

First of all, the subcatchment with HBV
![](figures/fig-icon_object_hbv.png){height="0.24in"} and GSM
![](figures/fig-icon_object_gsm.png){height="0.24in"} models will 
be set up. Then, the three rivers ![](figures/fig-icon_object_kinem.png){height="0.24in"} 
(with Kinematic Wave) and the two junctions
![](figures/fig-icon_object_junction.png){height="0.24in"} are also added as presented in @fig-examples_unlinked_objects_ex2
(more details are given in Example 1 for model construction, including
the link between each object and their parameterization).

![Unlinked objects of the model](figures/fig-examples_unlinked_objects_ex2.png){#fig-examples_unlinked_objects_ex2}

After that, the models are linked from upstream to downstream (@fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex2)
and the relations created can be visualized by double clicking on each blue
arrow (@fig-examples_possible_outputs_transfer_ex2,
@fig-examples_connection_between_objects_ex2).

![Relations between the objects](figures/fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex2.png){#fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex2}

\  

![Connections between objects](figures/fig-examples_connection_between_objects_ex2.png){#fig-examples_connection_between_objects_ex2}

The parameters associated to each object are then introduced (values
available in previous tables). The result is presented for both HBV 1
and GSM 1 models in @fig-examples_param_ic_hbv_gsm_ex2.

![Parameters of the HBV 1 model (left) and the GSM 1 model (right)](figures/fig-examples_param_ic_hbv_gsm_ex2.png){#fig-examples_param_ic_hbv_gsm_ex2}

Secondly, virtual weather stations are inserted. For its accomplishment,
4 Virtual Weather Stations ![](figures/fig-icon_object_station.png){height="0.24in"}
are created and connected according to @fig-examples_model_with_stations_ex2. 
The topology of the relations created in this case is detailed in 
@fig-examples_topologic_links_between_stations_ex2. Then the parameters are introduced 
(@fig-examples_param_station_ex2) with the available values presented previously.

Constructed model can be now saved clicking in the button
![](figures/fig-icon_save_button.png){height="0.24in"} and giving a name to the .rsm file (e.g.
"Example2.rsm").

Next, the meteorological data have to be loaded: the dialog box of the
database is opened clicking in ![](figures/fig-icon_database_open.png){height="0.24in"} 
(@fig-examples_database_frame_ex2) for loading the
corresponding database file ("Database manual.dbx").

![Database frame](figures/fig-examples_database_frame_ex2.png){#fig-examples_database_frame_ex2}

The user can click on the Database tab to visualize or modify the series
of the database (@fig-examples_database_model_ex2).

![Database of the model](figures/fig-examples_database_model_ex2.png){#fig-examples_database_model_ex2}

Once the database loaded, the user can connect the database to the
hydrological model. For achieving this purpose, the user has to choose
the correct data source in the corresponding frame (@fig-examples_datasource_connection_ex2): the
group "Measure" and the dataset "DataSet Example 2and3" for the current
example. Since no source, *TurbineDB*, reservoir or consumer objects
exist in the model, it is not necessary to fill up their data sources.

![Data source used for connecting the model to the database](figures/fig-examples_datasource_connection_ex2.png){#fig-examples_datasource_connection_ex2}

Finally, and after achieve a simulation, the weight of each
meteorological real station can be checked by clicking at one Virtual
Weather station of the hydrological model (@fig-examples_weight_station_ex2).

![Weight of each meteorological station for the Virtual Weather Station H1](figures/fig-examples_weight_station_ex2.png){#fig-examples_weight_station_ex2}

The pre-simulation validation
(![](figures/fig-icon_validation.png){height="0.24in"}) allows to valid the model. If the
message: "Model 'Example 2' is valid" appears, the simulation can be
started by clicking in the button Start.

## Results of Example 2

Once finished the calculation, the hydrograph in the outlet of the
system, among others, can be visualized (@fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex2).

![Hydrograph in the outlet of the system](figures/fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex2.png){#fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex2}

If we check the values (@fig-examples_discharge_values_ex2), we can found that the maximal
discharge arrives on May the 9^th^, 2013 at 07:00 and the discharge
value is 8.154 m^3^/s.

![Discharge values at outlet](figures/fig-examples_discharge_values_ex2.png){#fig-examples_discharge_values_ex2}

All the simulated variables of the model (including the discharge in
each sub-basin outlet) can be visualized (@fig-examples_selection_plots_subbasins_ex2
and @fig-examples_hydrographs_subbasins_ex2)
clicking on the "Selection and plots" frame and in selecting the series
to draw as presented in @sec-user_hydro_hydrau_simulation_selection_plots. Finally you can export the
selection results in excel format clicking in "Export results to..." in
the series frame.
