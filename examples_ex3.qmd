# Example 3 -- Equipped basin with a hydropower scheme {#sec-examples_ex3}

This example, allows showing the potential of RS MINERVE for equipped
basins. The model starts with the previous model built in Example 2 and
adds a hydropower scheme as well as a supplementary basin with an
intake. The complete model is presented in @fig-examples_model_scheme_ex3.

![Model scheme](figures/fig-examples_model_scheme_ex3.png){#fig-examples_model_scheme_ex3}

HBV 1, HBV 2 and GSM 1 basins flow through the Reservoir 1. Intake
located downstream of a SOCONT model provides supplementary discharge up
to 2 m^3^/s. It is assumed that the propagation in the channel is
insignificant and thus it is not necessary to include it in the model
(in other case, we could built it with the Reach Kinematic object).

The reservoir includes a turbine and a spillway. The turbine generates
electricity as long as it is possible for a capacity of 1 m^3^/s. These
two reservoir outflows flow in the River C up the outlet, where they are
joined by the production of HBV 3 sub-basin. All the parameters of the
different objects are provided in @fig-examples_characteristics_ex3_1 and
@fig-examples_characteristics_ex3_2. The temperature and
precipitation data are in the database "Database manual". A uniform
and null ETP is assumed for this example (the user can check the
selected ETP method in the RS MINERVE settings).

## Objective of Example 3

***Part A***

The wanted result for this example is the inflow in the reservoir, the
spillway discharge and the hydrograph in the outlet of the model for the
period between the 08.05.2013 00:00 and the 15.05.2013 00:00 (as well as
the peak discharge and the peak time).

***Part B***

Second issue aims to know if the reservoir could be managed in order to
reduce the peak in the outlet of the system. The objective of this
extension is to implement a facility to release water for preventive
purposes.

Additionally, initial discharge ($Qini$) of River C is in this case 1
m^3^/s.

## Resolution of Example 3 -- Part A

In the first place, the model of the Example 2 is opened. The connection
between the "Confluence" and the River C is erased and objects Virtual
Weather Station ![](figures/fig-icon_object_station.png){height="0.24in"}, SOCONT
![](figures/fig-icon_object_socont.png){height="0.24in"}, Reservoir

Turbine ![](figures/fig-icon_object_turbine.png){height="0.24in"} and
Junction ![](figures/fig-icon_object_junction.png){height="0.24in"} 
are added, as presented in @fig-examples_model_construction_ex3.

![Construction of the Example 3 model on the basis of Example 2](figures/fig-examples_model_construction_ex3.png){#fig-examples_model_construction_ex3}

New objects are always linked from upstream to downstream (e.g.: SOCONT
1 to Diversion 1, Diversion 1 to Confluence ($Qdiverted$) and to Outside
of the Basin ($Qdown$), Reservoir 1 to HQ 1, Reservoir 1 to Turbine 1,
Turbine 1 to River C, etc). After creating the links (@fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex3), the
news relations can be visualized by double clicking on each blue arrow
(@fig-examples_relations_station_ex3 to @fig-examples_relations_intake_ex3).

The introduced parameters of new objects Diversion 1, Reservoir 1, HQ 1
and Turbine 1 are presented in @fig-examples_relations_qup_qdiverted_diversion_ex3
to @fig-examples_discharge_turbine_ex3.

As shown in @fig-examples_discharge_turbine_ex3, the thresholds in the level of the reservoir to
start (2127 masl) and to stop (2110 masl) the turbine cycle, as well as
the first suggested value for the turbine cycle (1 = turbine) have to be
introduced.

Once the construction finished, it can be saved clicking in the button
![](figures/fig-icon_save_button.png){height="0.24in"} and giving a name to the .rsm file (e.g.
"Example3.rsm").

Before starting the calculation, the meteorological data have to be
loaded: the dialog box of the database is opened clicking in
![](figures/fig-icon_database_open.png){height="0.24in"} Open for loading the corresponding
database file ("Database manual"). The user can click on the Database
tab to visualize or modify the series of the database (@fig-examples_database_model_ex2).

Once the database loaded, the user can connect the database to the
hydrological model. For achieving this purpose, the user has to choose
the correct data source in the corresponding frame (@fig-examples_datasource_connection_ex3): the
group "Measure" and the dataset "DataSet Example 2and3" for the current
example. It is not necessary to fill up the data sources of the
reservoir as it will take the default value for the simulation.

![Data source used for connecting the model to the database](figures/fig-examples_datasource_connection_ex3.png){#fig-examples_datasource_connection_ex3}

Finally, the necessary parameters of the simulation are chosen in the
menu Solver frame according to the propose dates in the wording. The
other values (time intervals) stay as indicate in the program, being 600
s in both cases.

If the pre-simulation validation allows to valid the model (with the
message: "Model 'Example 3' is valid"), the simulation can be initiated
clicking in the button Start.

## Results of Example 3 -- Part A

All the results can be visualized by double clicking in the
corresponding object. @fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_A presents the hydrograph at the system
outlet.

![Outlet hydrograph](figures/fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_A.png){#fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_A}

The peak discharge arrives on May the 9^th^, 2013 at 21:40 and the peak
discharge is equal to 8.482 m^3^/s.

To summarize the simulated balance of Reservoir 1, an analysis of
inputs/outputs in the Reservoir 1 is realized with the "Selection and
plots" module. The inflow into the Reservoir 1 (Confluence), the
spillway discharge (HQ 1), the turbine flow (Turbine 1), the total flow
at the downstream of the reservoir (River C, $Qup$) and the reservoir
level evolution (Reservoir 1) are presented in @fig-examples_flows_balance_reservoir_ex3. Despite the
turbine, the reservoir level reached its maximal fill rating with an
overflow which lasted several days. At the end of the simulation, the
reservoir level comes around 90 cm above the initial level.

![Flows balance of the reservoir](figures/fig-examples_flows_balance_reservoir_ex3.png){#fig-examples_flows_balance_reservoir_ex3}

## Resolution of Example 3 -- Part B

In order to create an outlet or a facility for releases, one way is to
define a turbine connected to the reservoir (@fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex3_B). We create a
new turbine (Turbine 2) and make the connections from the reservoir to
the new turbine and from the turbine to River C. Also we create a time
series element connected to the new turbine where we will define the
releases from the reservoirs.

![Topology of the model including the new release](figures/fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex3_B.png){#fig-examples_topologic_links_between_objects_ex3_B}

Notice that actually the new turbine is representing a sluice of the
reservoir.

Once the model has been adapted we have to define the preventive
releases in the corresponding Turbine 2. Analyzing the results of the
example one can think that preventive release should start near 13h00 of
first day and finish eleven hours later.

As in the time series we have to define time in seconds (0 seconds
corresponds to the start time of the simulation), the start is at
46800 s and the end at 86400 s. Moreover, it is considered that the
release must take place only when the level in the reservoir exceeds
2128 masl, and stops when it is under 2125 masl.

The value of the releases depends on the capacity of the sluice and the
decision of the manager. In this case, a discharge of 5 m^3^/s is
defined, as presented in @fig-examples_release_turbine_ex3_B.

![Proposed release from the Turbine 2](figures/fig-examples_release_turbine_ex3_B.png){#fig-examples_release_turbine_ex3_B}

New objects are linked as before, from upstream to downstream, obtaining
same relations, as presented in @fig-examples_connection_between_objects_ex3_B.

![Connections between objects](figures/fig-examples_connection_between_objects_ex3_B.png){#fig-examples_connection_between_objects_ex3_B}

## Results of Example 3 -- Part B

In the following @fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_B we can see the new flows of the outlet and other
variables. As it can be seen the peak is reduced to less than 8 m^3^/s
due to the preventive releases at the outlet of the model (@fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_B).
Moreover, with the extra releases, we have created a first artificial
peak.

![Outlet hydrograph after the addition of the new release. Peak
discharge of 7.552 m^3^/s arrives now on May the 10^th^, 2013 at 02:10.](figures/fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_B.png){#fig-examples_outlet_hydrograph_ex3_B}

Maximum water level on the reservoir, 2128.473 m a.s.l., is at this
case smaller than without the extra release of Part A (maximum water
level of the part A was 2128.467 m a.s.l.).

To compared this results with the results of Part A, same results are
presented, i.e., an analysis of inputs/outputs in the Reservoir 1. The
inflow into the Reservoir 1 (Confluence), the spillway discharge (HQ 1),
the turbine flows (Turbine 1 and Turbine 2), the total flow at the
downstream of the reservoir (River C, $Qup$) and the reservoir level
evolution (Reservoir 1) are presented in @fig-examples_flows_balance_reservoir_ex3_B.

![Flows balance of the reservoir and hydrographs at main control points](figures/fig-examples_flows_balance_reservoir_ex3_B.png){#fig-examples_flows_balance_reservoir_ex3_B}

Although the objective has achieved, many issues emerge from the
management of the reservoir. How much water do we have to release? Are
we aggravating the situation downstream? How much energy will we lose if
the flood is not as important as expected? And so on.
