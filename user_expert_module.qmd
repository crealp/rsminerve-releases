#  Expert module {#sec-user_expert_module}

In this chapter, the four plugins of the Expert module are presented:

- Automatic calibration of hydrological model parameters

- Stochastic simulation

- Time-slices simulation

- Scenario simulation

## Calibrator {#sec-user_expert_module_calibrator}

The complexity of a hydrological model calibration increases with the
number of parameters to calibrate. The search for optimal values of
calibration parameters can be made manually to a reasonable number of
parameters. But in general, for large basins including hundreds or
thousands of parameters, it is essential to have an automatic
calibration tool.

In RS MINERVE, an automatic calibration can be realized in the *Calibrator* tool (@fig-calibrator_interface).

### Calibration configuration

Different types of calibration can be achieved for an optimization:

- Regular calibration: One or more zones with a unique downstream gauged station, calibrated with the same parameters for all zones.

- Calibration per zone: One or more zones with a unique downstream gauged station, calibrated with different parameters per zones.

- Regional calibration: One or more zones with several downstream gauged station, calibrated with the same parameters for all zones.

The creation of a new calibration configuration can be realized
following next steps (corresponding to the black boxes in the @fig-calibrator_interface):

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Selection* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface), select the object types to
  calibrate: press simultaneously *Ctrl* on keyboard and left click on
  the object types. Then define the corresponding zone(s) by clicking
  on the Zone Id number(s).</span>

> All the objects corresponding to the selected object types and zone(s) appear in the *Models* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface). The correspondent parameters are shown in the *Parameters* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface).

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Parameters* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface), select the parameters to
  calibrate. For each of them, define their minimum and maximum
  possible values (*Min* and *Max* columns) and the value to be used
  for the first iteration of the calibration (*From model*, *Defined*
  value or *Random* value).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">If more than one zone has been selected (*Selection* frame), a
  column *Values per zone* appears in the table. For the
  parameter(s) selected for calibration, a box appears in this
  column. If the box is checked, the calibration for the parameter
  will consider a different value for each zone. If not, the same
  value will be considered for all zones in the concerned
  calibration.</span>

> <span style="color:blue">Parameters can be imported in the model by clicking on ![](figures/fig-icon_calibrator_import_param.png){height="0.16in"} in the *Parameters import/export* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface).

<span style="color:blue">In the *Comparators* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface), select the comparator(s) whose

- <span style="color:blue">To stop the calibration, click on
  ![](figures/fig-icon_calibrator_stop.png){height="0.11in"} in the *Hydrologic parameters
  optimization* frame.</span> It takes a moment to stop until the current
  simulation ends.

### Calibration results

After each simulation during the calibration, the following results are
showed in the *Summary* *Results* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface and @fig-calibrator_textual_results):

- The Objective Function (OF), with its maximum possible value.

- The results of the simulation before optimization with initial
  parameters, initial indicators values and initial OF value.

- The results of the current iteration with its parameters values and
  the respective indicators values and OF value.

- The best result, with related parameters and OF value.

These results can be exported at all times by saving with the Save
button located in the same frame or by copying then pasting the text in
a file.

![Textual results of the calibration in progress](figures/fig-calibrator_textual_results.png){#fig-calibrator_textual_results}

If more than one comparator has been selected in the *Comparators*
frame, the Objective Function is equal to the sum of the objective
functions obtained at each compactor.

The results of the calibration in progress can also be visualized as
graphic form in the *Graphic* *Results* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface and @fig-calibrator_graphic_results):

- The *OF Progress* tab shows the temporal evolution of the Objective
  Function (OF), with Initial value in green, current value in red
  and all other values in orange. The activation of the mouse wheel
  on vertical axis allows to zoom on the OF values of interest.

- The *Comparator* tab allows following the progression of the current
  simulated variable (discharges or heights) with respect to the
  observed one. If more than one comparator had been selected for
  the calibration in the *Comparators* frame, the comparator to show
  can be modified by clicking on the one of interest in the same
  frame.

![Graphic results of the calibration in progress. Evolution of the Objective function (left) and hydrograph of both observed and current simulated discharge (right).](figures/fig-calibrator_graphic_results.png){#fig-calibrator_graphic_results}

At the end of the calibration:

- The parameters obtained for the best *Objective Function* value are
  applied in the current model. If the model is saved, the
  parameters are stored; if not, the hydrological model keeps the
  initial parameter values.

- The parameters can be also exported in a file by clicking on
  ![](figures/fig-icon_calibrator_export_param.png){height="0.18in"} in the *Parameters import/export* frame (@fig-calibrator_interface).

### Multiple calibration

Additionally, in combination with all possible optimizations, multiple
calibrations can be achieved:

- Unconnected basins calibration: several independent basins can be
  calibrated if the same "order" is provided for all of them.

- Upstream-downstream basins calibration: Different dependent basins
  can be calibrated from upstream to downstream ("order" grows up
  from upstream to downstream).

Parallel and series calibration can be combined for a complex basin as
presented in example of @fig-calibrator_example_with_basins, where two unconnected basins are
calibrated in Calibration A and Calibration B, then a downstream basin
is calibrated in Calibration C and, finally, a more downstream basin is
calibrated in Calibration D.

![Example of a calibration with two unconnected basins and two basins upstream](figures/fig-calibrator_example_with_basins.png){#fig-calibrator_example_with_basins}

## Scenario simulation

To evaluate the model sensitivity (i.e. the simulated flows) to the
Initial Conditions, to the parameters and also to the meteorological
inputs, it is necessary to run a lot of simulations to test different
sets of values. But for the user it is very tedious to launch these many
scenarios simulations.

In RS MINERVE, scenario's simulations can be realized in the *Scenario
simulation* tool.

- <span style="color:blue">Click on the *Expert module* in the *Toolbox* frame (@fig-rsm_interface) and then on the *Scenario simulation* (@fig-scenario_simulation_interface).</span>

![Interface of the Scenario simulation module (in black: configuration; in green: results)](figures/fig-scenario_simulation_interface.png){#fig-scenario_simulation_interface}

### Scenarios configuration

A scenario is composed of a combination of input datasets (one for each
type of *Input data*), a set of initial conditions and a set of
parameters. Except the dataset for the *Station* input (meteorological
inputs) when the model contains at least one *Virtual weather station*,
all other inputs are optional. Initial conditions and parameters can be
provided as text or worksheet files.

All possible combinations composed of every input type with at least one
dataset or input file are proposed, but the user can erase undesired
simulations.

The creation of a new scenarios configuration can be achieved following
next steps (corresponding to the black boxes in @fig-time_slice_simulation_interface):

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Inputs* frame (@fig-scenario_simulation_interface), click on the *DataSets* tab
  (@fig-scenario_simulation_inputs). Select the dataset(s) to be used as data sources for
  the different *Inputs*: Station, TurbineDB, Source, Reservoir and
  Consumer (only object types existing in the model are listed). For
  example, for the *Station* data source, click on *Station* in the
  left part*,* search the corresponding dataset name(s) in the right
  part and check it/them.</span>

![*Inputs* frame in the Scenario simulation tool](figures/fig-scenario_simulation_inputs.png){#fig-scenario_simulation_inputs}

- <span style="color:blue">Click on the Initial conditions tab (@fig-scenario_simulation_inputs). If you want to add
  initial conditions (IC) file(s), click on
  ![](figures/fig-icon_add_button.png){height="0.16in"} and import the desired IC files. The
  selected ones are listed in the *Inputs* frame.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Click on the Parameters tab (@fig-scenario_simulation_inputs). If you want to add
  parameters file(s), click on ![](figures/fig-icon_add_button.png){height="0.16in"} and import the desired parameters
  files. The selected ones are listed in the *Inputs* frame.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Selection* frame (@fig-scenario_simulation_interface), choose the *model selection*
  to be used.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Then, select the object's series to be displayed.</span>

The *model selection* is also used for the results exportation.

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Outputs* frame (@fig-scenario_simulation_interface), define the outputs to be
  recorded: *All results* (all the simulation results of the model)
  and/or *Results from selection* (which considers only the above
  selected model selection). For each one, it is possible to record:</span>

    - <span style="color:blue">*Each simulation:* one dataset will be produced by time-slice (see *Simulation period* in *Solver frame* at @fig-scenario_simulation_interface)</span>

    - <span style="color:blue">*Combined simulations*: only one dataset will be produced for all the period</span>

    - <span style="color:blue">*Nothing:* no dataset will be produced</span>

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Solver* frame (@fig-scenario_simulation_interface), specify:</span>

    - <span style="color:blue">Both *Simulation* and *Recording* time steps</span>

The period of each scenario simulation will only correspond to the
period covered by all the datasets composing the scenario. If the
covered periods for a scenario do not overlap for more than one time
step, a gray progress bar is displayed (since simulation cannot be
achieved).

The name of the output file of each scenario is composed by merging the
names of all the datasets used for the scenario. The input type of each
dataset (e.g. Station, Source) is added before the name of each dataset
(e.g. "Station-Datameteo_Source-Datasource...")

![Progress state after succes (left) and failure (right) of the simulation](figures/fig-scenario_simulation_progress_simulation.png){#fig-scenario_simulation_progress_simulation}

- <span style="color:blue">Click on ![](figures/fig-icon_calibrator_stop.png){height="0.12in"} in the *Solver* frame if necessary
  to stop the simulation. All results until that moment are saved.</span>

### Scenarios results

After simulation of each scenario, following components are showed:

- In the *Selection* frame: the temporal evolution of the selected object's series.

- In the *Comparators* frame: the values of indicators checked at the
  top left of the frame (*Indicators to visualize*).These values are
  displayed as graphical and tabular forms and correspond to the
  comparator selected in the bottom left of the *Comparator* frame.

During the simulation, you can change all the objects or all indicators
or all comparators to visualize by clicking on or checking them. The
tabular results of indicators can be exported at all times by copying
then pasting the text in a file.

At the end of the scenario simulation, the outputs datasets are
available in the same repository than those of the database.

## Stochastic simulation

This tool is capable of generating a set of simulations based on
different parameters or initial conditions with values located in a
defined user interval. For each element of the model, simulated
hydrographs, corresponding statistics (mean, median, quartiles, minimum
and maximum values), and related set of parameters for each simulation
are provided. This module has implemented 4 types of probability
distributions, uniform, normal, log normal and exponential. Also, it is
possible to define a custom probability distribution with a txt file, to
get more information go to the Technical Manual.

Sometimes the complexity of a hydrological model requires a sensitivity
analysis to collect a set of simulations. The possibility to analysis
the results of a model depending of a range parameter is really useful
to know the variability of the model. This module generates a lot of
information, all the results simulations, generated parameter series and
finally a statistic results.

In RS MINERVE, an automatic stochastic simulation can be realized in the
*Hydrological calibration* tool (@fig-stochastic_simulation_interface).

- <span style="color:blue">Click on *Expert* module and then on the Stochastic Simulation (@fig-stochastic_simulation_interface).</span>

### Stochastic configuration

The creation of a new Stochastic simulation configuration can be
realized following next steps (corresponding to the black boxes in 
@fig-stochastic_simulation_interface):

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Selection* frame (@fig-stochastic_simulation_interface), select the object types to
  simulate: press simultaneously *Ctrl* on keyboard and left click on
  the object types. Then define the corresponding zone(s) by clicking

  will consider a different value for each zone. If not, the same

## Time-slice simulation

The computation duration logically increases with the model complexity
but also with the simulation period length. Thus, simulations on long
periods with short time steps and a complex model can become
inappropriate for user's computer performance. In this case, it is
necessary to clip the simulation period in time-slices.

In RS MINERVE, a time-slice simulation can be realized in the
*Time-slice simulation* tool.

- <span style="color:blue">Click on *Expert* module and then in the *Time-slice simulation* tool (@fig-time_slice_simulation_interface).</span>

The creation of a new time-slice configuration can be achieved following
next steps (corresponding to the black boxes in @fig-time_slice_simulation_interface):

- <span style="color:blue">In the *Inputs* frame (@fig-time_slice_simulation_interface), select the dataset(s) for each

  - <span style="color:blue">*Each simulation:* one dataset will be produced by time-slice

![Visualization of indicators at the different comparators](figures/fig-time_slice_simulation_visualization_indicators.png){#fig-time_slice_simulation_visualization_indicators}

Objects selection in the *Selection* frame as well as indicators and
comparators to consider in the *Comparators* frame can be modified
during the Time-slice simulation.

The tabular results of indicators can be exported at any time by copying
them and pasting the text in a file.

  For each selection, specify its weight, the optimization type
  (maximize or minimize) and the value we want to maximize/minimize
  (the maximum value of the series, the minimum value, the average or
  the value for a specific K date).</span>

  series selected. This could be used to optimize damages instead of
  discharges. For this purpose, the user can create a conversion curve
  adding at least two points in the "Table conversion" on the right.
  When the points are added, the Convert option for this result can be
  enabled.</span>

### Optimization results

During the optimization running, the following results are displayed in
the *Summary* *Results* frame (@fig-planner_optimizator_interface and @fig-planner_optimizator_text_results):

- The Objective Function (OF), with its maximum possible value.

- The results of the simulation before the optimization with the
  initial Planner parameters and the initial OF value.

- The results of the current iteration with its Planner parameters
  values and the respective values of the OF value.

- The best result, with related parameters and OF value.

The results can be exported for all iterations at the end of the process
with the Save button located in the same frame. The summary results can
also be copy -pasted the text in a file.

The results of the optimization in progress are also displayed
graphically in the *Graphic* *Results* frame (@fig-planner_optimizator_interface):

- The *OF Progress* tab shows the evolution of the Objective Function
  (OF), with its Initial value in green, the current value in red
  and all other values in orange. The activation of the mouse wheel
  on the vertical axis allows to zoom on the OF values of interest.

At the end of the optimization:

- The Planner parameters obtained at the end of the optimization
  process are applied to the model. If the model is saved, the
  parameters are stored; if not, the Planner objects keep the
  initial (non-optimized) parameters.
