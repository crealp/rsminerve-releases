# Database  {#sec-user_database}

The different input data as well as exported results are managed within
a database. The *Database* tab is used to create or edit the database
linked to the active model.

## The Database tab

The *Database* tab appears when a database is created (![](figures/fig-icon_database_new.png){width="0.17in" height="0.17in"} *New)* or opened for edition (
![](figures/fig-icon_database_open.png){width="0.17in" height="0.17in"} *Open* and then
![](figures/fig-icon_database_edit.png){width="0.17in" height="0.17in"} *Edit*).

![The *Database* tab](figures/fig-database_tab.png){#fig-database_tab}

The database structure is organized in five hierarchical levels, listed hereafter.

- **Database** Description of the database, complete set of data

    - **Group** Separation based on category of data (Measures, Forecasts, Simulations,...)[^user_12]

        - **Dataset** Set of data of common type (Meteo data, Flow data,...)

            - **Station** Information about the station (name and coordinates)

                - **Sensor** Description of the sensor (name, units and data)

[^user_12]: Definition and use of *Groups* and *Datasets* can also be done in a different way by the user.

## Creation of a database

The creation of a new database can be achieved following next steps:

- <span style="color:blue">Click on ![](figures/fig-icon_database_new.png){width="0.17in" height="0.17in"} *New* in the *Database* frame (@fig-rsm_interface) and save the new database. 
The *Database tab* is opened (@fig-database_tab).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Create the components of the different hierarchical levels of your database by using the ![](figures/fig-icon_plus.png){width="0.17in" height="0.17in"} *Add* 
button (*Edition* frame).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">For the stations, give an adequate name and enter the coordinates.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">For each sensor:</span>

    - <span style="color:blue">Define the *Description* (name), *Category,* *Unit and Interpolation* method.</span>

    - <span style="color:blue">Select the "Values" tab and add the data with the ![](figures/fig-icon_paste.png){width="0.16in" height="0.16in"} *Paste* button (after copying them from 
	any spreadsheet program).</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Save the database.</span>

The data can be managed (exported or imported) as database or as dataset.

To manage a **database**, proceed as follows:

- <span style="color:blue">To save a database: Click on the *Database* component $\rightarrow$ *File database* $\rightarrow$ *Save as*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">To load another database: Remove the current database and click on ![](figures/fig-icon_database_open.png){width="0.17in" height="0.17in"} *Open* in the *Database* 
frame to open the new database.</span>

To manage a **dataset**, perform as follows:

- <span style="color:blue">To export a dataset: Click on the Dataset component $\rightarrow$ *File Dataset* $\rightarrow$ *Save*</span>

- <span style="color:blue">To import a dataset: Click on a Group component $\rightarrow$ *File Dataset* $\rightarrow$ *Import*</span>

If a dataset contained in a database is also stored separetely as a dataset (not only in the database), both have to be saved (*File
database* $\rightarrow$ *Save;* *File dataset* $\rightarrow$ *Save*) to properly modify all the files!

## Data format

For copying series values in a sensor, two columns are necessary. The
first column contains the data in one of these formats:

- dd.mm.yyyy

- dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm

- dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm:ss

The second column contains the values of the series (example in @fig-example_data_format_sensors).

![Example of data format to use in the sensors](figures/fig-example_data_format_sensors.png){#fig-example_data_format_sensors}

##  Connection of a database to a model

Once the database is created, links between the model and the database
have to be implemented. The *Data source* frame (@fig-data_source_frame, left),
located in the main interface and available only when a database is
opened, is used for this purpose.

- <span style="color:blue">Define for the *Station* and the *Source* the corresponding *Group* and *DataSet*.</span>

- <span style="color:blue">For the *Source* objects, define in the *Object description* frame the correct station under the ![](figures/fig-icon_arrow_down_menu.png){width="0.15in" height="0.17in"} 
*Select from database* button (@fig-data_source_frame, right).</span>[^user_13]

The name of the station appears under *Station identifier* and is stored
in the model when the model is saved.

![Left: The Data Source frame; Right: Definition of the station for objects Source](figures/fig-data_source_frame.png){#fig-data_source_frame}

[^user_13]: Source objects have to be linked to another object to define the type of output (and corresponding units) before the link to the station can be defined.

### Interaction between the database and the active model

Modifications of the database in *Database tab* (without saving them!)
are taken into account during simulations of the active model. However,
when the database is closed, only saved changes will be applied to the
database. Therefore, proper saving of the modifications is recommended.
