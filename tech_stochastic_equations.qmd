## Introduction to the stochastic simulation {#sec-tech_stochastic_equations_intro}

The problem of identifiability is basic to all statistical methods and data analysis and it occurs in diverse areas such as reliability theory, survival analysis, 
econometrics, etc., where stochastic modelling is widely used [@prakasa_rao_identifiability_1992].

The module Stochastic of the Expert frame has been implemented for launching multiple simulations depending of the object's selected parameters. This module uses 
probability distributions to calculate the simulation parameters. The defaults results are two CSV files, one of them is a statistics series of all the simulations 
and the other is a parameter series with a selected distribution. The user can save all the simulation in a single file when the process is finished.

## Probability distributions {#sec-tech_stochastic_equations_distributions}

A probability distribution assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment. The predefined distributions are uniform, 
normal, log normal, exponential and finally it is possible use a customized distribution (@fig-probability_distributions).

![Probability distributions of the stochastic simulations module](figures/fig-probability_distributions.png){#fig-probability_distributions}

For define a correct probability distribution, the area under the probability density function must be equal to 1. For other hand, cumulative distribution function is 
bounded between 0 and 1 and also it must be non-decreasing and right-continuous.

### Uniform

The continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of symmetric probability distributions such that for each member of the family, all intervals 
of the same length on the distribution's support are equally probable. @fig-distribution_uniform shows an example with a bounded $X$ between \[-5, 5\].

### Normal

The normal distribution (or Gaussian distribution) is a very common continuous probability distribution. Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often 
used to represent distributions are not known. Several characterizations of the univariate and the multivariate normal distribution are known [@kagan_characterization_1967; @prakasa_rao_identifiability_1992].
The normal distribution is sometimes informally called the bell curve. The following @fig-distribution_normal shows an example with a bounded $X$ axis between \[-5,5\], 
where is more probable to find an $X$ value.

**Probability density function:**

$$
\varphi = f(x\ |\ \mu,\ \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{- \frac{(x - \mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
$$ {#eq-SE1}

with $\mu$: mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode); $\sigma^{2}$: variance; $\sigma$: standard deviation.

**Cumulative distribution function:**

$$
\phi = f(x\ |\ \mu,\ \sigma) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \Bigg( 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{- \Big( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}} \Big)}^{\Big( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}} \Big)}e^{{- t}^{2}} \mathrm{d}t \Bigg)
$$ {#eq-SE2}

The normal distribution is useful because of the central limit theorem. In its most general form, under some conditions, it states that averages of random variables 
independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal, that is, become normally distributed when the number of random variables is 
sufficiently large.

### Log normal

A log-normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Consequently, if the random variable $X$ 
is log-normally distributed, then $Y = ln(X)$ has a normal distribution. Likewise, if $Y$ has a normal distribution, then $X = e^y$ has a log-normal distribution. A random 
variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values [@johnson_14_1994]. @fig-distribution_lognormal shows an example with a bounded $X$ axis 
between \[0, 2\], where is more probable to find an $X$ value.

![Log normal distribution. Probability density function (left), cumulative distribution function (right)](figures/fig-distribution_lognormal.png){#fig-distribution_lognormal}

**Probability density function:**

$$
\varphi = f(x\ |\ \mu,\ \sigma) = \frac{1}{x\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{- \frac{\left( \ln x - \mu \right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
$$ {#eq-SE3}

with $\mu$: mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode); $\sigma^{2}$:  variance; $\sigma$  standard deviation.

**Cumulative distribution function:**

$$
\phi = f(x\ |\ \mu,\ \sigma) = \frac{1}{2}\left\lbrack 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{- \left( \frac{\ln x - \mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}} \right)}^{\left( \frac{\ln x - \mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}} \right)}e^{{- t}^{2}}dt \right\rbrack
$$  {#eq-SE4}

A log-normal process is the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, each of which is positive. This is justified by 
considering the central limit theorem in the log domain. The log-normal distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate $X$ for which 
the mean and variance of $ln(X)$ are specified [@park_maximum_2009].

### Exponential

The exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson point process. Is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located 
on a mathematical space [@chiu_stochastic_2013]. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, and it has 
the key property of being memoryless. @fig-distribution_exponential shows an example with a bounded $X$ axis between \[0, 10\], where is more probable to find an $X$ value.

![Exponential distribution. Probability density function (left), cumulative distribution function (right)](figures/fig-distribution_exponential.png){#fig-distribution_exponential}

**Probability density function:**

$$
\varphi = f(x\ |\ \lambda) = \lambda e^{- \lambda x}
$$ {#eq-SE5}

with $\lambda$: the parameter of the distribution, often called the rate parameter ($λ>0$).

**Cumulative distribution function:**

$$
\phi = f(x\ |\ \lambda) = 1 - e^{- \lambda x}
$$ {#eq-SE6}
  
### User defined

For define a custom probability distribution, the user must create a text file with two columns (@fig-distribution_custom, left). The first column is the cumulated probability 
and the second it is for the $X$ value associated. The middle values are calculated with a linear interpolation method. @fig-distribution_custom right is the cumulative 
distribution for a user defined distribution.

![Custom distribution. Format distribution file (left). Cumulative distribution function (right).](figures/fig-distribution_custom.png){#fig-distribution_custom}

@fig-probability_density_custom shows the probability density function for the user defined distribution. As same to cumulative distribution, program calculate middle point 
through linear interpolation.
