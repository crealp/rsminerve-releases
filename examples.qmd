# Examples of application {#sec-examples}

In this chapter, some examples of application are presented in order to
deepen the knowledge of the program. These basic examples are designated
to facilitate the learning of the program RS MINERVE. The examples are
organized according to the degree of difficulty.

The use of RS MINERVE in case studies has demonstrated the capacity of
the program to correctly reproduce the real behavior of river basins. In
addition, the program facilitates the search of different scenarios of
operation while optimizing complex systems in a satisfactorily way.

This chapter contains three examples with didactic aims:

-   [Example 1](#sec-examples_ex1) -- Simple basin with only runoff.

-   [Example 2](#sec-examples_ex2) -- Combined full basin with meteorological stations.

-   [Example 3](#sec-examples_ex3) -- Equipped basin with a hydropower scheme.

-   [Example 4](#sec-examples_ex4) -- Automatic calibration of a model
